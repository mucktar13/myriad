Myriad Social is a Web3 Social Media platform that functions as a layer on top of regular social media. Initially built on top of Octopus Network, Myriad Social has now expanded to support multiple blockchain networks, including Octopus Network and NEAR blockchain.

In our latest milestone, we have introduced a refreshed user interface aimed at enhancing the overall user experience and simplifying platform interactions. This update brings streamlined functionalities, intuitive navigation, and comprehensive guides to assist both new and existing users.

## 1. Polkadot Setup, Connection, and User Guide

We have revamped the Polkadot wallet integration process to make it more user-friendly. A step-by-step guide with interactive tooltips now assists you through every stage of connecting your Polkadot wallet.

Additionally, the **simplified connection flow** reduces the number of steps and offers clearer instructions, ensuring you can connect your wallet seamlessly. Furthermore, enhanced visuals with intuitive graphics guide you through the entire process, making the experience more user-friendly and visually appealing.

## 3. Simplified Timeline Discovery and First Step Guide for New Users

Discovering new timelines and managing your own is now more intuitive thanks to a revamped layout and enhanced search capabilities, allowing users to discover new timeline based on tags user want to see or dont want to see.

The first step for user is to click the create timeline button that redirects user to our multi staged timeline creation interface designed to prevent information overload to user while still allowing user to have more granular control over their timeline.

These features work together to ensure a smooth and comprehensive onboarding experience, helping you become familiar with the platform efficiently and effectively.

### Exclusive Timeline

![Exclusive Timelines](./create-exclusive-timeline.png)

We have introduced the Exclusive Timeline feature, which allows you to mark specific timeline content as exclusive. Here's how to create one:

1. Click the "Create New Timeline" button in the left sidebar to start creating a new timeline

2. In the creation form, you'll find an "Exclusive" toggle switch that lets you mark your timeline as exclusive content

3. After filling in your timeline details, click the "Next" button to proceed with creating your exclusive timeline

Your timeline name can be between 1-50 characters, and you can optionally add a description (up to 280 characters). You can also set the privacy level (Public, Private, etc.) and customize the timeline picture.

When a timeline is marked as exclusive, it will be clearly indicated with an exclusive label, helping differentiate it from regular timelines in the listing.

## 4. B2B Features: Multi-User Management System

We have implemented comprehensive B2B features that enable organizations to manage multiple users, timelines, and content metrics efficiently through a single interface. This enterprise-grade functionality provides organizations with powerful tools for team collaboration and content management.

- **Seamless Authentication**: Quick login process using generated tokens

### Multi-User Capabilities

Our B2B implementation offers essential features for team management, including timeline collaboration for shared contributions, a content metrics dashboard to track engagement and performance, and access level management to control user permissions. Designed with a focus on security and usability, this multi-user system empowers businesses and organizations to strengthen their social media presence while maintaining control over their digital assets.
